# Bonded Blueberry ($bdBLB)

Bonded Blueberry is the vesting rewards token, distributed every two weeks to those holding bTokens, the receipt token for lending on Blueberry markets.

Bonded Blueberry is the vesting governance token. 1 $bdBLB is redeemable for 1 $BLB over the course of 1 year. However, this vesting concept differs from traditional vesting, which unlocks tokens over time.

Instead, $bdBLB introduces Acceleration Fee Vesting.

The Acceleration Fee is the price a $bdBLB holder must pay to the DAO treasury to have their vesting accelerated, unlocking tokens immediately. These fees are then used to purchase $BLB and provide $BLB-USDC liquidity, offsetting the effects of short-term liquidity providers. The acquired liquidity is sent to a public burn address.
Claiming

$bdBLB is distributed and claimable each Monday of every two weeks, called an “Epoch.”

## Acceleration Fee Mechanics

When a distribution occurs, the Initial Acceleration Fee is set automatically based on the price of the underlying BLB \* 0.7.

Over the 1-year vesting period, the Acceleration Fee decreases linearly, without regard to the underlying $BLB price.

When an Acceleration is performed by paying the fee, a user receives 90% of the underlying BLB they have claim to. 10% is redistributed to other holders of that Epoch’s batch of bdBLB.

### Rationale: This model disincentivizes short-term liquidity providers, rewarding long-term believers in the protocol, and builds long-term liquidity for the benefit of the entire ecosystem, while still allowing users to exit. Fees are taken by the DAO treasury and used to buy back and make liquidity for the token.

Climbing FDV for Lockdrop

A significant number of $bdBLB tokens will be distributed during the Lockdrop 60-day phase, where lenders lock liquidity in exchange for token rewards.

The $bdBLB token and the $BLB token will not be live or transferable during this period. After 60 days, both will go live and become transferable.

The Climbing FDV is a novel mechanic to reward those taking the most risk fairly. To align with the decreasing risk level, the FDV will increase every 15 days, 4 times total in the 60 days. The earlier you provide liquidity, the lower your acceleration fee will be at launch.

To reiterate, this mechanism provides the lowest acceleration fees to the earliest liquidity providers, and allows all lockdrop lenders to receive tokens beneath the launch price of the market.

Additionally, the DAO will distribute an airdrop based on user activity during this period. The airdrop will be awarded in regular $BLB governance tokens, with the goal to distribute governance power to users with the most skin in the game and most productive contributions to the protocol.
